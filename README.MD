Arduino ```.ino``` is meant to be "fast and easy way to do something, when you know nothing". And it works, as anybody and his dog can start with Arduino and if interested. 

**I know nothing** about real AVR/C programming, so I won't use any make lists etc. for now. 

If you want to use this piece of crap (why?) install each library by yourself using standart Arduino library manager.
